20231011 - 45.0

  Creation of preferences widgets has also been modified.

20230611 - 44.1

list item is dragged.  The old one stopped working.

20230329 - 44.0

Update for GNOME 44.
- Alter how the monitor manager is obtained in Bottom Panel.

20220919 - 43.0

Update for GNOME 43.
- Since GNOME Shell commit 35494f5d0 (popupMenu: Close when source actor
  gets hidden) the 'mapped' handler for AppIconMenu in Panel Favorites is
  unnecessary.
- Since GNOME Shell commit a88e59c1a (Adopt EventEmitter class instead
  of injecting Signal methods) it's no longer necessary to add signals
  to AppIconMenu in Panel Favorites.

20220612 - 42.1

Bottom Panel: update window list when a window changes workspace.

20220330 - 42.0

Update for GNOME 42.
- Applications Menu and Move Clock only need '42' added to metadata;
- Some menu text in Panel Favorites has been changed to match upstream;
- The workspace switcher popup in Bottom Panel has been updated to have
  the new upstream appearance.  The directional arrows are no longer
  required.

20220326 - 41.3

Panel Favorites:  tidy up timeouts.

Bottom Panel:  the modifications to support the new window tracking
mechanism broke the ability to change the order of items in the
window list.  Further revise window tracking to fix this.

Bottom Panel:  remove timeouts when things are destroyed
(FripperySwitcherPopup and TooltipContainer).

20220117 - 41.2

Bottom Panel:  GNOME Shell 41.3 changed how new windows are tracked.
To get a valid return from WindowTracker.get_window_app() in the
window added callback it's necessary to switch from using the
MetaWorkspace::window-added signal to MetaDisplay::window-created.
Otherwise new windows don't show up in the window list.

20210924 - 41.1

Some code churn to placate a reviewer.

20210924 - 41.0

Various minor changes to Bottom Panel.  The main visible result of
this is that window list items now fill the height of the panel.

20210525 - 40.2

Bottom Panel:  Move width specification for window list items from the
label to the containing box.  Otherwise the text suffers from strange
truncation and isn't always updated properly.

20210502 - 40.1

Correctly display workspace switcher popup when moving to first or last
workspace.
When dynamic workspaces are enabled Bottom Panel should ignore the
number of rows set by the user and display a single row of workspaces.
When Bottom Panel is disabled the workspace layout should revert to
horizontal.

20210326 - 40.0

Update for GNOME 40.
- Pass the current time to dialog open()/close() functions.  The
  lack of this caused a fatal error on X.
- Update preference dialogs to GTK 4.
- Reduce the spacing between icons in Panel Favorites.

Remove flags argument in calls to Clutter.Actor.set_allocation and
Clutter.Actor.allocate.

20201003 - 3.38.0

Bottom Panel settings dialog, as was already done in prefs.js.
Silence warnings about use of object.actor for CheckBox.

20200421 - 3.36.1

Use different names for ApplicationMenuItem in Panel Favorites and
Applications Menu.
When Panel Favorites is disabled remove its button from the panel.
Rather than destroy the Applications Menu button when it's disabled
just hide it so it can be shown if re-enabled.  Update settings when
the Applications Menu is re-enabled.
Remove support for turning off the hot corner in Applications Menu:
this is now controlled by org.gnome.desktop.interface.enable-hot-corners
which is exposed by GNOME Tweaks.
When Applications Menu is disabled only show the Activities button if
it's needed by the current session mode.

20200315 - 3.36.0

Update for GNOME 3.36.  Cope with the usual random code churn:
- TableLayout is no longer available; use GridLayout instead.
- When adding children to containers the runtime complains that "Some
  code tried to set a deprecated GObject property".  Properties need
  to be set on children before they're added.
- Symbols like Clutter.Return have been removed; use replacements of the
  form Clutter.KEY_Return.
- The _onEvent method in PanelMenu.Button has been renamed vfunc_event.
- ApplicationMenuItem in Panel Favorites needs to be registered as a
  GObject.

(Reported by Paul Smith.)

20181031 - 3.30.1

Fix the right-click menu for items in Panel Favorites.

20180930 - 3.30.0

Update for GNOME 3.30.
There is a bug in mutter which causes workspaces to behave as though
they are all in a single column even if a different layout has been
requested.  A workaround has been applied in the Bottom Panel extension
but since the window menu isn't managed by the extension the window
movement entries are incorrect.  The similar menu in the window list
is correct.

20180930 - 3.28.3

When window-added and window-removed callbacks are disconnected in
WindowList set their ids to zero.  This avoids errors being logged when
the bottom panel is recreated after the screen is locked.
Disconnect signals handlers for tracked windows when the bottom panel
is destroyed.
In Bottom Panel, ensure workspaces that are out of range don't cause
problems in the workspace switcher.

20180730 - 3.28.2

setting (rather than having to set the state for each workspace
individually).

20180617 - 3.28.1

Panel.  This fixes a problem with dragging window list items not
working properly when desktop items are enabled.  (Reported by konradmb.)
Save the window list sequence when the Bottom Panel extension is
disabled, as happens when the screen is locked.  This allows the order
of items in the window list to persist.  (Reported by mlara.work.)

In Panel Favorites, update display of other applications when list is
altered.

20180312 - 3.26.3

them.  Based on a patch provided by Igor Coelho.
Allow the bottom panel to be disabled on all workpaces including the
first.
Add support for an additional set of applications in Panel Favorites.
These need not be favourites and will be displayed in a separate
button.  Add a preferences dialog to allow these additional applications
to be configured.  The default settings mean that the behaviour of an
unconfigured Panel Favorites installation is unchanged from before.
Adjust style of Bottom Panel tooltips.
Make PanelFavorites a subclass of PanelMenu.Button.  As a result we
no longer need to provide a private version of Panel.addToStatusArea
to permit a non-PanelMenu.Button to be added to the panel.  We do need
to provide a menu.  Also tweak the stylesheet.
When an application is started from Panel Favorites in the overview
hide the overview.  (Patch provided by Ahmad Samir.)
