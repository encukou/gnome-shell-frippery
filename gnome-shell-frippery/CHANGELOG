20180930 - 3.30.0

Update for GNOME 3.30.
There is a bug in mutter which causes workspaces to behave as though
they are all in a single column even if a different layout has been
requested.  A workaround has been applied in the Bottom Panel extension
but since the window menu isn't managed by the extension the window
movement entries are incorrect.  The similar menu in the window list
is correct.

20180930 - 3.28.3

When window-added and window-removed callbacks are disconnected in
WindowList set their ids to zero.  This avoids errors being logged when
the bottom panel is recreated after the screen is locked.
Disconnect signals handlers for tracked windows when the bottom panel
is destroyed.
In Bottom Panel, ensure workspaces that are out of range don't cause
problems in the workspace switcher.

20180730 - 3.28.2

Allow the bottom panel to be disabled on all workspaces with a single
setting (rather than having to set the state for each workspace
individually).

20180617 - 3.28.1

Exclude windows of type DESKTOP from the window list in the Bottom
Panel.  This fixes a problem with dragging window list items not
working properly when desktop items are enabled.  (Reported by konradmb.)
Save the window list sequence when the Bottom Panel extension is
disabled, as happens when the screen is locked.  This allows the order
of items in the window list to persist.  (Reported by mlara.work.)

20180502 - 3.28.0

In Panel Favorites, update display of other applications when list is
altered.

20180312 - 3.26.3

Allow window list items in the bottom panel to be arranged by dragging
them.  Based on a patch provided by Igor Coelho.
Allow the bottom panel to be disabled on all workpaces including the
first.
Add support for an additional set of applications in Panel Favorites.
These need not be favourites and will be displayed in a separate
button.  Add a preferences dialog to allow these additional applications
to be configured.  The default settings mean that the behaviour of an
unconfigured Panel Favorites installation is unchanged from before.
Adjust style of Bottom Panel tooltips.
Make PanelFavorites a subclass of PanelMenu.Button.  As a result we
no longer need to provide a private version of Panel.addToStatusArea
to permit a non-PanelMenu.Button to be added to the panel.  We do need
to provide a menu.  Also tweak the stylesheet.
When an application is started from Panel Favorites in the overview
hide the overview.  (Patch provided by Ahmad Samir.)
